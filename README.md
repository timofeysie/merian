## React first workspace creation

If a workspace is created with a React app to start following [this document](https://nx.dev/getting-started/nx-and-react).

npm install -g nx

Or use npx:

npx create-nx-workspace@latest

```shell
C:\Users\timof\repos>npx create-nx-workspace@latest
npx: installed 58 in 10.745s

## The Core first then Angular approach fails

These are notes about the failed core workspace with Angular first approach.

There are different approaches to creating a workspace.  Some are tailored to a particular framework, and some are framework agnostic.  Creating a "core" workspace should make this workspace work for any type of framework.

```

Nx started out as an Angular-only affair.  It's creators were on the Angular team and left to focus on corporate-level issues when creating enterprise Angular apps.

Maybe for this reason I have had issues using Angular in a core workspace.  The big difference is instead of an angular.json, there is a workspace.json.  There may be advice and plugins out there that don't work with this change, so understand when you go the multi-framework route, there is a bit more to worry about sometimes.

There is actually [a section about splitting angular.json into multiple project.json files](https://nx.dev/getting-started/nx-and-angular#angularjson), one for each project.  I wish I had read that some time ago.

*anything written about project.json or workspace.json applies to angular.json in the same way. For instance, everything in project.json and nx.json applies to angular.json in the same way.*

First install the Angular plugin.

npm install @nrwl/angular

We run into this issue immediately when starting a new app:

nx generate @nrwl/angular:app customer-portal --routing

ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\timof\repos\demo-app\packages\customer-portal\project.json'

I added some comments on [this GitHub on Nx](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/8778#issuecomment-1107446490) for the issue, but it doesn't matter as going with the React project first solves the issue.

## NextJS

npm install --save-dev @nrwl/next

nx g @nrwl/next:app sibylla

### React CLI commands

nx g @nrwl/next:lib my-new-lib
nx g @nrwl/next:page my-new-page --project=my-new-app
nx g @nrwl/next:component my-new-component --project=my-new-app
nx serve sibylla --prod

### The Nx React todo example

<https://nx.dev/react-tutorial/01-create-application>

We will use the my-new-app trash app to do this.

By default, Nx uses Cypress to run E2E tests.

nx e2e my-new-app -e2e --watch

Doesn't work.

### AMP

AMP inside a NextJS app.

The [official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/amp-support/introduction) point to this [GitHub example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/amp)

Using the pages and components for that demonstrates using normal page (non-AMP), an AMP only page, and a hybrid AMP page.

But there is an error in index.tsx:

```html
      <amp-img
        alt="Mountains"
```

Property 'amp-img' does not exist on type 'JSX.IntrinsicElements'.ts(2339)
No quick fixes available

There are a few fixes available according to [these SO answers]():

```tsx
declare namespace JSX {
 interface IntrinsicElements {
  [elemName: string]: any;
 }
}
```

I'm not sure exactly where these would be used, but putting this in the index.tsx files doesn't work.

Another answer says that this works:

```tsx
declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      [elemName: string]: any;
    }
  }
}
```

But neither of those are working for the index.tsx file.

### Typescript and AMP

<https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/amp-support/typescript>

There is a [road map discussion](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/amp-support/typescript) that is now closed.

At the end of the discussion someone links to [this example](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/pull/37370):

```ts
import {compile} from './compile';

[globalThis as any]('compile') = compile;
globalThis.compile = compile;
```

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/web`
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/angular`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@merian/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
